class main {
    public static int[] reverse(int [] a){
        int [] b = new int[a.length];
        int j=0;
        int i;
        for(i=a.length-1; i>= 0; i--){
            b[j]=a[i];
            j++;
        }
        return b;
        }
    
    public static void main(String [] args){
        int [] a={8,4,6,5,9,2};
        int [] result= reverse(a);
        System.out.print("Reverse array: ");
        for(int i=0; i<result.length; i++){
            System.out.print(result[i] + " ");

}
The first thing I want to do is create an array and give input values to it, followed by creating a second array, b, and assigning a pointer that starts at index 0. Then, using a for loop, the index i starts at the last element of the array and ends at the first element, decrementing with each iteration
During each iteration, the value at index i of the first array is assigned to index j of the second array, b, effectively reversing the array.” ✅
